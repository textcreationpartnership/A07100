            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> of this treatiſe.</p>
            <p n="28">28 Secondly, that vve refute ſometime one of their tranſlations, ſometime an other, and euery one as their falſhod giueth occaſion. Neither is it a good defenſe for the falſhod of one, that it is truely tranſlated in an other: the reader being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by any one, becauſe commonly he readeth but one.

            <p n="31">31 Fifthly, that the very vſe and affectation of certaine termes, and auoiding other ſome, though <pb facs="tcp:12653:10"/>it be no demonſtration againſt them, but that they may ſeeme to defend it for true tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlation, yet was it neceſſarie to be noted, becauſe it is &amp; hath been alvvaies a token of heretical meaning.</p>
            <p n="32">32 Sixtly, that in explicating theſe things, vve haue endeuoured to auoid (as much as vvas poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) the tediouſnes of Greeke &amp; Hebrue vvordes. vvhich are only for the learned in theſe tongues, and vvhich made ſome litle doubt vvhether this matter (vvhich of neceſſitie muſt be examined by them) vvere to be vvritten in Engliſh or no. but being perſuaded by thoſe (vvho them ſelues haue no ſkill in the ſaid to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues) that euery reader might reape commoditie thereby, to the vnderſtanding &amp; deteſting of ſuch falſe and Heretical tranſlations, it vvas thought good to make it vulgar and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to al our decre countrie men, as the nevv Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament it ſelf is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, vvhereof this Diſcouerie is as it vvere an handmaid, attending therevpon for the larger explication and proofe of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions there breefely touched, and for ſupplie of other ſome not there mentioned.</p>
            <p n="33">33 Seuenthly, that al the Engliſh corruptions here noted and refuted, are either in al or ſome of their Engliſh bibles printed in theſe yeres, 1562. 1577.1579. And if the corruption be in one Bible, not in an other, commonly the ſaid Bible or bibles are noted in the margent: if not, yet ſure it is that it is in one of them, and ſo the reader ſhal finde it, if he finde it not alvvaies in his ovvne Bible. And in this caſe the reader muſt be very vviſe and circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that he thinke not by and by vve charge them falſly, becauſe they can ſhevv him ſome later edition that hath it not ſo as vve ſay, for it is their common and knovven faſhion, not onely in their tranſlations of the Bible, but in their other bookes and vvritinges, to alter and change, adde and put <pb facs="tcp:12653:10"/>out, in their later editio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, according as either them ſelues are aſhamed of the former, or their ſcholers that print them againe, diſſent and diſagree from their Maiſters. So hath Luthers, Caluins, and Bezas vvritinges and tranſlations been changed both by them ſelues and their ſcholers in many places, ſo that Catholike men when they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute that which they finde euident faultes in this or that edition, feare nothing more then that the reader hath ſome other edition, where they are corrected for very ſhame, and ſo may conceiue that there is no ſuch thing, but that they are accuſed vvrongfully. for example.

            <p n="35">
               <note place="margin">Vve charge them not with forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the old approued Latin text, though it be an il ſigne, &amp; to their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</note>35 Laſtly and principally is to be noted that we wil not charge them vvith falſifying that vvhich in deede is the true and authentical Scripture, I meane the vulgar Latin Bible, vvhich ſo many ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res hath been of ſo great authoritie in the Church of God, and with al the auncient fathers of the Latin Church, as is declared in the preface of the Nevv Teſtament: though it is much to be noted, that as Luther, only in fauour of his hereſies did vvilfully forſake it, ſo the reſt folowed and do folovv him at this day, for no other cauſe in the vvorld but that it is againſt them. &amp; therfore they inueigh againſt it,<note place="margin">Kemnitius.

            <p n="36">36 And concerning their vvilful and heretical auoiding thereof in their nevv tranſlations, vvhat greater argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t can there be then this, that Luther, vvho before alvvaies had readde vvith the Gath.

            <p n="37">37 So doe they in infinite places alter the old text, vvhich pleaſed them vvell before they vvere Heretickes, and they doe it vvith braſen faces, and plaine proteſtation, hauing no ſhame nor remorſe at al, in fleeing from that which all antiquitie with one conſent allovved and embraced vntil their vnhappie daies.

               <p n="2">2 The firſt marke and moſt general is: If they tranſlate els vvhere not amiſſe,<note place="margin">Euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes or ſignes to knovv vvilful cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in tranſlating.</note> and in places of controuerſie betvvene them and vs, moſt falſely: it is an euident argument that they doe it not of negligence, or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, but of partialitie to the matter in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie. This is to be ſeen through the vvhole Bible, vvhere the faultes of their tranſlations are altogether, or ſpecially, in thoſe Scriptures that concerne the cauſes in queſtion betvvene vs. For other ſmal faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, or rather ouerſightes, vve vvil no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther note vnto them, then to the end, that they may the more eaſily pardon vs the like, if they finde them.</p>

If, as in their opinions &amp; hereſies, they forſake the auncient fathers: ſo alſo in their tranſlations, they goe from that text &amp; aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reading of holy Scriptures, vvhich al the fathers vſed and expounded: is it not plaine that their tranſlation folovveth the veine and humor of their hereſie? And againe if they that ſo abhorre from the <pb n="3" facs="tcp:12653:16"/>auncient expoſitions of the fathers, yet if it ſeeme to ſerue for them, ſticke not to make the expoſition of any one Doctor, the very text of holy Scripture: vvhat is this but he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical wilfulnes?

If there be an external ſacrifice, <pb n="73" facs="tcp:12653:51"/>there muſt be an external Prieſthod to offer it, an altar to offer the ſame vpon. ſo had the Gentiles their ſacrifices, Prieſts, and altars: ſo had the Ievves: ſo Chriſt him ſelf being a Prieſt according to the order of Melchiſedec, had a ſacrifice, his body: and an altar, his Croſſe: vpon the vvhich he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it.
